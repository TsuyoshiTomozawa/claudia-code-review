# Contributing to Claudia Code Review

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Claudia Code Review as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

### Rust
- Use `cargo fmt` to format your code
- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Use `cargo clippy` to catch common mistakes

### TypeScript/React
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow React hooks patterns
- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any` types unless absolutely necessary)

### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable)
- Bun (latest)

3. Create UI components in `src/components/review/`
4. Ensure proper cleanup of resources
5. Add status tracking and progress indication

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/TsuyoshiTomozawa/claudia-code-review/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please provide:

- **Use case**: Describe the problem you're trying to solve
- **Proposed solution**: How you envision the feature working
- **Alternatives**: Other solutions you've considered
- **Additional context**: Screenshots, mockups, or examples

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to [security@claudia-code-review.com] instead of using the issue tracker.
